                    <h2>1.Why to choose casting over forging for huge production?</h2>
                    <p>Die casting is the most efficient process for high volume precision castings. This process
                        produces castings with the highest tolerances, strength as well as having the highest production
                        rates. Although initial tooling costs are high but with casting, extremely high volumes can be
                        achieved.</p>

                    <h2>2.How to achieve 100% customer satisfaction with 0 complaints?</h2>
                    <p> Speed is critical. Customers expect a 24 hour response time. They are delighted by hearing from
                        you within 6 hours and amazed by a 1 hour response. The faster you respond to your customers the
                        easier it becomes to close a sale or solve a problem. Failure to return a call or email is
                        inexcusable.
                        When responding to a customer complaint always begin by assuring the customer that you will fix
                        their problem. This immediately removes the adversarial relationship that can lead to messy and
                        expensive confrontations.</p>

                    <h2>3.What is alloying and is application?</h2>
                    <p>Alloy is a metal made by combining two or more metallic elements, especially to give greater
                        strength or resistance to corrosion.
                        Aluminium alloys are widely used in the fields of electric module packaging, electronic
                        technology, automotive body structure, wind and solar energy management, due to the advantages
                        of high specific strength, high processability, predominantly anti-erosion, increased
                        conductivity, eco-friendly nature and recoverability.

                    <h2>4.What is VMC Machining and it’s Benifits?</h2>
                    <p>VMC machining refers to machining operations that utilize vertical machining centers (VMCs),
                        which, as the name suggests, have vertically oriented machine tools. These machines are
                        primarily utilized to turn raw blocks of metal, such as aluminum or steel, into machined
                        components. They can be used to perform a variety of machining operations, including, but not
                        limited to, the following: cutting, drilling, tapping, countersinking, chamfering, carving, and
                        engraving. This versatility, combined with their relatively low cost, has made them a highly
                        common machine shop tool.</p>

                    <h4>Benefits of VMC-</h4>
                    <p> - Simpler structure. The simple structure of VMCs makes it easy to clamp the workpiece in the
                        necessary position.
                        <br>
                         - Better cooling efficiency. Gravity works with the VMC design. Coolant sprayed at the top of the
                        machine tool and workpiece trickles down to cover the rest of the target.
                        <br>
                         - Easier setup and operation. VMCs have a wide field of vision, enabling operators to observe the
                        operations and, if needed, make modifications to resolve any issues.
                        <br>
                         - Smaller space requirements. The vertical design takes up less floor space than a horizontal
                        design.
                        <br>
                         - Higher accuracy. VMCs can produce complex shapes and structures with a high degree of accuracy.

                    <h2>5.What is Die casting and it’s scope?</h2>
                    <p>Die casting is a much more modern, technologically advanced form of metal shaping. The metal is
                        melted and forced into a closed die via hydraulic or pneumatic pressure, where it will then cool
                        into the desired shape. The resulting component is considered a “casting.” Once it has cooled
                        and hardened, the ejection process can begin, allowing for the removal of the piece.</p>

                    <h2>6. why should we go for zinc or Aluminium castings?</h2>
                    <p>Zinc casting alloys provide a better combination of strength, toughness, rigidity, bearing,
                        performance and economical castability than any other alloy possible. In fact their properties
                        often exceed the ones of other alloys such as aluminium, magnesium, bronze, plastics and other
                        cast irons.
                        <br><br>
                        Aluminium castings is chosenbecause it has demonstrably the best combination of physical and
                        mechanical properties for casting, including being lightweight, very strong at high temperatures
                        and corrosion resistant also excellent strength-to-weight ratio, electrical/thermal conductivity
                        and high ductility
